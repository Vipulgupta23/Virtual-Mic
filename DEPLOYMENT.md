1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "Start a New Project"
3. Sign up with your GitHub account (free)

### Step 3: Deploy from GitHub
1. Create a GitHub repository:
   - Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
   - Click "New repository"
   - Name it "virtual-mic-system"
   - Make it public (required for free tier)
   - Click "Create repository"

2. Upload your code to GitHub:

   - Follow GitHub's instructions to upload your code

3. Deploy on Railway:

   - Select your "virtual-mic-system" repository
   - Railway will automatically detect it's a Node.js app
   - Click "Deploy"

### Step 4: Wait for Deployment
- Railway will build and deploy your app (takes 2-3 minutes)
- You'll get a free URL like: `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app`

## Option 3: Vercel (Frontend Only)

**Note**: Vercel is primarily for frontend apps. Since your app has a backend server, use Railway or Render instead.

---

## Quick Setup Instructions:

1. **Download your project files** from Replit
2. **Create GitHub repository** and upload files
3. **Choose Railway** (easiest) or Render
4. **Connect GitHub** and deploy
5. **Your app will be live** in 3-5 minutes!

## Important Notes:
- Your app uses in-memory storage, so data resets when the server restarts
- The free tiers have some limitations but are perfect for testing and demos
- Both Railway and Render provide HTTPS automatically
- Your app will be accessible worldwide via the provided URL
